# The VocalPy Community

VocalPy is a software community for researchers studying
acoustic communication in animals:
from fly buzzes to human speech, and any other vocalizations you can think of,
including bird songs, bat calls, dolphin whistles, and mouse squeaks.
The software consists of a set of interoperable Python packages
built around a core library, also named VocalPy.
Our goal is to build a sustainable community
of users, maintainers, and developers of the software,
that will better help us all understand how and why
animals communicate with sound.
